Because this interval starts at a = x0, there are n + 1 points to account for the starting point. Parts of this interval are called subintervals, and are defined by [xi , xi+1]\n",

        "Riemann’s Integral: This integration technique works off of creating rectangles from subintervals; recall that a subinterval is made from an x coordinate, and its subsequent x coordinate. These x coordinates each correspond to a y value, and a rectangle can be built from the 2 (x,y) pairs. This rectangle is then an approximation of the area spanned across this subinterval. When these estimations are summed up, an estimation has been made for the entire interval.\n",

        "There are 3 main ways to assign the rectangles height, based off of the y coordinates in question. The left y coordinate can be used, the right y coordinate can be used, and the mid point of these 2 coordinates can be used. Generally, the midpoint method will be at least 1 order of accuracy above the left and right methods, as it uses both y coordinates to build its estimation, leading to greater accuracy for what the actual rectangle height should be approximating. This can be shown in code as well:"
